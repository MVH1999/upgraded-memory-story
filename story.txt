There once was a young boy named Billy. He lived in a small village called
SmalleVille. It is on top of a small hill and surrounded by small trees.
There was one thing that Billy was curious of and that was the only big
thing in the village. It was a giant tree, and the villagers called it
Yggdrasil. One day, Billy went to explore the tree.

That tree looks mysterious and is scared by people in a village.
when he decided to explore that tree, poeple stoped him to not go because it is dangerous.
However, billy didn't listen to them and went to explore that tree.
It was long way to the tree and there are many dangers to go to the tree.
