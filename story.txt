There once was a young boy named Billy. He lived in a small village called
SmalleVille. It is on top of a small hill and surrounded by small trees.
There was one thing that Billy was curious of and that was the only big
thing in the village. It was a giant tree, and the villagers called it
Yggdrasil. One day, Billy went to explore the tree.

That tree looks mysterious and is scared by people in a village.
when he decided to explore that tree, poeple stoped him to not go because it is dangerous.
However, billy didn't listen to them and went to explore that tree.
It was long way to the tree and there are many dangers to go to the tree.

On his way to the tree, Bill was barked by a huge dog. The dog stands in front of him, and trying to prevent him going any closer to the tree. Just when Bill was confused, he noticed that he has a piece of jerk in his pocket. He throw the jerk to the dog, so the dog stopped barking and followed Bill since then. 
With the dog by his side, Billy ventured on. His next obstacle was a sphinx.
She wouldn't let him pass unless he answered her riddle.Her ridlle went like
this: what has four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon and three at night.
Billy thought long and hard until he figured it out . A man as a baby, an adult
and an old man with a stick. The sphinx was pleased with his answer and let him carry on.
