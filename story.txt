There once was a young boy named Billy. He lived in a small village called
SmalleVille. It is on top of a small hill and surrounded by small trees.
There was one thing that Billy was curious of and that was the only big
thing in the village. It was a giant tree, and the villagers called it
Yggdrasil. One day, Billy went to explore the tree.
